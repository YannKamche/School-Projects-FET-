# Data-Structures
This repository contains implementation of some data structures and algorithms using C programming Language 
- Stacks <br>
- Linked List<br>
- Queues<br>
- Sorting<br>
- Circular array implemenation of Queues and Stacks<br>
- Array implementation of Queues and Stacks<br>
- Linked List implementation of Queues and Stacks<br>
<br>

## Added a Rar file named Data Structure that contains all the c programs

In here, you will find all the codes I wrote concerning the different Algorithm below: <br>
- Queue using array and Linked List
- Queue using circular array
- Stack using array and Linked List
- Inserting in a linked list at first, last and n position
- Destroying a linked list
- Reversing a linked list
- Displaying a linked list
<br>
NB: The C file linked list.c  has  deleting, reversing, displaying, inserting at n position implemented in it. <br>
Commented the codes for readability.
